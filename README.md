# shopping_list

## **[Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com) exercise used to practice using git and github.**

Shopping List is a simple program written in python that allows you to add or remove items to a shopping list. As well as, display the shopping list whenever you need to see what you've entered and when finished displays the whole list.

Below you can see an image of Trello. Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. If you would like to try it out [click here](https://trello.com/). This showcases the planning stage and breaking up the project into steps.

When approaching this project. I have attempted to write the code myself and, have made many changes and added extra things myself to make the program work better.
